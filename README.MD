# SingleFileZ
SingleFileZ is a fork of [SingleFile](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/single-file) that allows you to save a webpage into a self-extracting HTML file. This HTML file is also a valid ZIP file which contains the resources (images, fonts, stylesheets and frames) of the saved page.

Examples of files produced by SingleFileZ can be found here: https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/SingleFileZ/tree/master/examples

Today, it is only available on Firefox. You can download the extension here: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/singlefilez/

To open saved pages in Chrome, you must start it with the switch `--allow-file-access-from-files`. That's why the extension will probably never be published on the Chrome store.

Note that JavaScript must be enabled to unzip and view saved pages.
