# SingleFileZ
SingleFileZ is a fork of [SingleFile](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/single-file) that allows you to save a webpage into a self-extracting HTML file. This HTML file is also a valid ZIP file which contains the resources (images, fonts, stylesheets and frames) of the saved page. This ZIP file can be unzipped on the filesytem in order to view the page in a browser that would not support pages saved with SingleFileZ.

## Examples
Here is an example of page produced by SingleFileZ: https://gildas-lormeau.github.io/. Other examples of files can be found here: https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/SingleFileZ/tree/master/examples

## Download
Today, SingleFileZ is only available on Firefox. You can download the extension from the Firefox Add-ons website: https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/singlefilez/

SingleFileZ can be installed on Chrome. However, to open saved pages from the filesystem in Chrome, SingleFileZ must be installed or Chrome must be started with the switch `--allow-file-access-from-files`.

## Notes
 - JavaScript must be enabled to view saved pages.
