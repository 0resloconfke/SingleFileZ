# SingleFileZ
SingleFileZ is a fork of [SingleFile](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/single-file) that allows you to save a webpage into an auto-extractable zipped HTML file.

An example of file produced by SingleFileZ can be found here: https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/SingleFileZ/tree/master/example

Today, it is only available on Firefox. You can download the extension here: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/singlefilez/

To open saved pages in Chrome, you must start it with the switch `--allow-file-access-from-files`. That's why the extension will probably never be published on the Chrome store.

*This is a work in progress*
