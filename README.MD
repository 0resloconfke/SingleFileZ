# SingleFileZ
SingleFileZ is a fork of [SingleFile](https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/SingleFile) that allows you to save a zipped webpage into an auto-extractable HTML file.

Today, it is only available on Firefox. You can download the extension here: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/singlefilez/

To open saved pages in Chrome, you must start it with the switch `--allow-file-access-from-files`.# SingleFileZ
