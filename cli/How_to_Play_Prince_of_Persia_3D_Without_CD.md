However, playing Prince of Persia 3D on modern systems can be a challenge, as the game requires a CD to run and has compatibility issues with newer versions of Windows. Fortunately, there are some solutions that can help you enjoy this game without having to insert the CD every time or deal with crashes and glitches.
 
One of these solutions is to use a no-CD crack, which is a modified executable file that bypasses the CD check and allows you to run the game without the disc. There are several no-CD cracks available online for Prince of Persia 3D, but one of the most popular ones is the v1.1 crack by PDM. This crack not only removes the CD requirement, but also updates the game to the latest version (1.1), which fixes some bugs and improves performance.
 
To use this crack, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Download the crack from [here](https://megagames.com/download/295079/0).
2. Install the game from the original CDs or from an ISO image.
3. Copy the following directories from CD2 into your game directory: /AUDIO/MUSIC /DATA/ /GEOMETRY/ROOMS/
4. Extract the contents of the crack archive into your game directory, overwriting any existing files.
5. Run POP3DPATCH1\_01.EXE to apply the patch.
6. Run POPREAL.EXE to play the game.

Note that you may need to install Quicktime or Quicktime Alternative to play the in-game movies. You may also need to use compatibility mode or other tools to fix any graphical or sound issues.
 
Another solution is to use a virtual drive software, such as Daemon Tools or Alcohol 120%, which can create a virtual CD-ROM drive on your computer and mount an ISO image of the game disc. This way, you can trick the game into thinking that you have inserted the CD, while actually running it from your hard drive. To use this method, you need to follow these steps:

1. Download a virtual drive software from its official website and install it on your computer.
2. Create an ISO image of CD2 using a disc burning software, such as Nero or ImgBurn.
3. Launch the virtual drive software and mount the ISO image on a virtual drive.
4. Install the game from CD1 or from an ISO image.
5. Run POP3D.EXE to play the game.

Note that you may still need to install Quicktime or Quicktime Alternative and use compatibility mode or other tools to fix any issues.
 
With these solutions, you can enjoy Prince of Persia 3D without having to worry about inserting the CD every time or dealing with compatibility problems. Have fun exploring the Sultan's palace and fighting Rugnor's minions!
